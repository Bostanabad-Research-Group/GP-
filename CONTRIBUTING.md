Developer workflow for code contribution is as follows:

1. Fork the repository

- Create a fork of GPPlus repository to have your own copy of the codebase that you can modify.

2. Create a new branch

- Clone your forked repository to your local machine
- Create a new branch for your specific changes. It's recommended to name the branch descriptively, reflecting the nature of your contribution.

3. Create a Pull Request

- Make changes in your local branch following project's coding style guide.
- Push changes to your personal fork.
- Once the changes are ready for review, you can create a Pull Request to merge the changes from a branch of your fork into a branch of upstream.
    - Make sure you update the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

4. Merging your Pull Request

- The PR will be accepted after adequate review and testing has been completed and the corresponding issue will be closed. Note that every PR should correspond to an open issue and should be linked on Github.
